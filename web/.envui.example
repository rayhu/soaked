# Log Levels are accumulative. Levels above also cover levels below. Available levels are:
# ========================================================================================
# Trace: Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data. These messages are disabled by default and should never be enabled in a production environment.
# Debug: Logs that are used for interactive investigation during development. These logs should primarily contain information useful for debugging and have no long-term value.
# Info: Logs that track the general flow of the application. These logs should have long-term value.
# Warning: Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop.
# Error: Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure.
# Fatal: Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention.
# ========================================================================================
LOG_LEVEL=Debug

# Log Method: choices are Console, File, and DB. Choices can be combined, such as: Console, File, DB
